Build Your Project
Remember - For this project, you won't need to implement the actual music playing functionality.
The goal of this project is to design and layout a music playing app that displays the list of available songs in a ListView or a GridView, navigates to a details screen of the currently playing song, and uses explicit intents to navigate around the app.
Data about each song should be stored in a custom class that is retrieved and displayed via a Loop and Adapter.

Getting Started
First, take a look at different kinds of music player apps on the market - check out the Play Music app, the Pandora Radio app, and the Spotify app to start with.
What type of user flow do you envision your app to have?

Design Planning
Once you've made a decision regarding the kind of app you would like to build, write out a couple of ways you could structure your app. Think about where a user will start and what the most common use cases of the app will be.
At minimum, your app should have 2 screens (a Main screen displaying the list of available songs using a list or grid & a Details screen of the currently playing song). There should be no more than 6 screens.
Some ideas for Activities would be:
1. "Now playing" screen
2. List artists, albums, playlists, or podcasts
3. Detail screen or screens for individual artists, albums, or podcasts
4. Store screen for buying music online
5. Search screen

If your app include buttons, use OnClickListener objects. Each activity should have a TextView that displays the purpose of the activity, as well as buttons that will let you navigate to other activities.
If you need help generating bitmaps for your project, refer back to the Generating Your Own Bitmaps concept.

The required components for this project are:
1. 2 to 6 Activities that are linked via explicit intents
2. A custom class storing information about each song. Each instance of the custom class must contain at least 2 states (e.g. Song Name, Artist Name). Images (e.g. Album Art) are not required but allowed.
3. A data structure, such as an ArrayList that would store Instances of the custom class. These instances should be retrieved and displayed in a ListView or GridView via an Adapter.
4. Your project will be evaluated using the Musical Structure project rubric.
